# num_game
A very simple game you can play in your terminal I created in about an hour or so. I created this in python before building out a nicer version on my personal website: https://jsod11.github.io

NumGame gives you a number which you must type as quickly as possible. There are a few options â€” you can input a command line argument to train just the left hand, just the right hand, or both, and your time per input and mistakes are counted.

Try

```
python3 num_game.py left
```
or
```
python3 num_game.py right
```
or
```
python3 num_game.py ones
```

I had the idea to make this game after playing https://arithmetic.zetamac.com, which I think is fun but lacks some optionality, such as reaction-time training. I intend to build on zetamac at some point, not in python but probably in JS on my personal website.

My best reaction time for the 0-9 option hovers around 0.5-0.6 seconds per button with zero mistakes, although I often fall in the range of 0.6-0.7 seconds with 2-5 mistakes.
